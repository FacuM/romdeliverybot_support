Say hi to Robbie! I'm a small Telegram bot written entirely in Python, based off two awesome modules: pyTelegramBotAPI and PyGithub.

I'm not very smart, but go ahead, ask me anything, I'll do my best! :)

#### Usage
The usage is pretty simple: feed me up with a bunch of content off the if-else statements. Then, fire up the `main.py` file, located at the root of this project.

Oh, by the way, don't forget to define your Telegram API key! On whatever system you're in, define a shell/environment variable called `API_KEY` and put in there your key.

#### TODO
- Minimize the user activity on internals.
- Improve performance (implement _AsyncTeleBot_).
- Fix a bunch of possible security issues.
- Use an actual database and implement OAuth token authentication.
